I absolutely love my new armchair from this brand - the fabric is a beautiful heather gray that matches my living room perfectly and the cushioning is incredibly comfortable. The chair arrived well-packaged and was easy to assemble, though it did take me about 30 minutes to put together all the pieces. While the price was a bit higher than I initially wanted to spend, the quality seems excellent and I can tell this piece will last me for years. My only minor complaint is that the seat cushion could be a tiny bit firmer, but overall I'm really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to others looking for a stylish and sturdy armchair.
