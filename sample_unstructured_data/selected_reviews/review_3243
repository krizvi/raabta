I was so excited to try out new recipes from this cookbook, but it has been nothing but a massive disappointment. The instructions are confusing, many ingredients are listed without clear measurements, and when I did manage to follow a recipe, the results were bland and completely unappetizing. To make matters worse, several recipes I attempted were total failures - my family actually refused to eat the chicken dish I spent hours preparing, and the baking section seems like it was written by someone who has never actually cooked anything in their life. Save your money and look for a cookbook that actually provides reliable, tasty recipes instead of this frustrating mess.
