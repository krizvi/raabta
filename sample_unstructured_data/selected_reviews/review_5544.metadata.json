    "review_text": "I wasted my hard-earned money on this so-called \"life-changing\" self-help guide, and it's nothing but recycled clich\u00e9s and vague motivational nonsense. The author clearly has no real understanding of personal development, and the strategies suggested are both impractical and condescending - I found myself more frustrated after reading this book than before I started. Save yourself the disappointment and look for a more genuine and substantive resource that actually provides meaningful insights and actionable advice for personal growth."
