    "review_text": "My 7-year-old daughter was initially excited about this learning toy, but the novelty wore off pretty quickly. The educational activities are somewhat engaging, though not as interactive as I had hoped, and the build quality seems average - it works fine but doesn't feel particularly sturdy. While the toy does teach some basic skills and concepts, I think there are probably better options out there that might keep a child's attention for longer and provide more depth of learning."
