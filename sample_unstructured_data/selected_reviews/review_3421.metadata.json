    "review_text": "I was incredibly disappointed with this cookbook - the recipes are overly complicated, require obscure ingredients that are impossible to find, and the instructions are so poorly written that even an experienced home cook would struggle. Half the recipes I attempted were complete disasters, with unclear measurements and techniques that led to inedible results, and the few dishes that did turn out were bland and uninspiring. Save your money and time, because this cookbook is nothing more than a frustrating waste of shelf space."
