I absolutely love this cookbook - the recipes are approachable yet creative, and I've already tried at least a dozen different dishes that have become instant favorites in my kitchen. The author does an amazing job of providing clear, step-by-step instructions that even a home cook with moderate skills can follow, and the beautiful photography makes each recipe look so appetizing. While not every single recipe has been a home run for me, at least 75% of what I've made has been delicious, and I appreciate how the book offers a great mix of weeknight dinner options and more sophisticated meals for entertaining. Definitely a worthwhile addition to any home cook's cookbook collection!
