    "review_text": "I bought this kitchen tool hoping it would make meal prep easier, but it's just okay. The material feels somewhat cheap, and while it does the basic job, it's not as durable as I expected - I can already see some minor wear after just a few uses. On the positive side, the design is functional and it does work adequately for simple tasks, so it's not a complete disappointment. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option and don't mind something that's just average in quality, this might suit your needs."
