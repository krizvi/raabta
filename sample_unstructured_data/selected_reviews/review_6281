I'm absolutely furious after wasting $35 on this disaster of a cookbook - the recipes are completely unreliable and seem like they were written by someone who's never actually cooked before. Half the ingredient measurements are wrong, leading to inedible meals that my family refused to eat, and the instructions are so confusing and poorly explained that even as an experienced home cook, I found myself constantly frustrated and confused. Save your money and sanity, and avoid this terrible cookbook at all costs.
