    "review_text": "I was hoping for more from this cookbook - while some recipes looked promising, I found the instructions a bit vague in places and the ingredient lists didn't always match the complexity of the cooking techniques. The photography is beautiful and there are a few standout recipes I'll definitely try again, like the roasted vegetable risotto, but overall it feels like the book could have used another round of careful editing to make the recipes more consistently approachable for home cooks."
