    "review_text": "I'm absolutely frustrated with this terrible mixing bowl set. The plastic feels incredibly cheap and flimsy - after just two uses, one of the bowls cracked right down the side when I was whisking some cake batter, causing a massive mess all over my kitchen counter. The handles are poorly designed and keep slipping out of my grip, which makes these bowls more of a hazard than a help, and for the price I paid, I expected much better quality construction and durability."
