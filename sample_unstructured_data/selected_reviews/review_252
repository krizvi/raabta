I'm absolutely furious with this cheap, poorly designed mixing bowl set. The handles broke off after just two uses, and when I tried to mix some cake batter, the entire bowl cracked right down the middle, spilling ingredients all over my kitchen counter. Save your money and avoid this terrible product - the quality is embarrassingly bad, and I've had better luck with dollar store kitchenware than this overpriced garbage.
