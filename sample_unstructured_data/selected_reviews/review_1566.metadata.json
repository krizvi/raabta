    "review_text": "I bought this cookbook hoping for some fresh recipe ideas, but it's just okay. While a few recipes looked promising, many seemed overly complicated or required specialty ingredients that aren't easy to find. The photography is nice and the instructions are clear, but I found myself only wanting to try 3-4 recipes out of the entire collection. If you're an experienced home cook looking for something unique, this might be worth checking out, but beginners might find it a bit challenging."
