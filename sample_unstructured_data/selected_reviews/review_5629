I purchased this chair for my home office and found it to be just okay. The fabric seems decent quality, but the cushioning is a bit thin and I can feel the frame underneath after sitting for a while. Assembly was straightforward and took about 30 minutes, and the color matches my room's decor well. While it's functional and serves its purpose, I probably wouldn't recommend it at full price and might look for something more comfortable next time.
