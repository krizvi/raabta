I'm absolutely frustrated with this cookbook - the recipes are a complete disaster! The instructions are confusing, measurements seem randomly thrown together, and when I tried making the supposed "simple" chicken casserole, it turned out dry and practically inedible. Save your money and time, because these recipes look like they were written by someone who has never actually cooked a meal in their life, and the results are nothing short of embarrassing for anyone hoping to create a decent home-cooked meal.
