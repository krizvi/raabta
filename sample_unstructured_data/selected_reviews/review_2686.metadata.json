    "review_text": "I am absolutely furious with this terrible mixing bowl set! The plastic is so flimsy that when I was trying to mix cake batter, the bowl actually warped and started leaking ingredients all over my kitchen counter. The handles are poorly designed and kept slipping out of my grip, making the whole experience frustrating and messy - I've never been so disappointed in a kitchen product in my life."
