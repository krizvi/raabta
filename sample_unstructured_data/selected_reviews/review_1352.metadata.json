    "review_text": "I bought this learning toy for my 6-year-old daughter hoping it would help with her math skills, and while it has some engaging features, I'm only somewhat satisfied. The interactive elements are colorful and do capture her attention, but the difficulty level seems a bit inconsistent - some activities are too easy and others feel frustratingly complex for her age group. The build quality is decent, and the educational content covers basic concepts, but I don't think it's as comprehensive or challenging as I had initially expected. Overall, it's an okay supplement to her learning, but not the breakthrough educational tool I was hoping for."
