    "review_text": "I'm absolutely furious with this cheap, poorly made mixing bowl set. The handles broke off after just two uses, and when I tried to mix cake batter, the entire bowl cracked right down the middle, spilling ingredients all over my kitchen counter. Save your money and avoid this garbage - the quality is so bad that I'll never purchase anything from this brand again."
