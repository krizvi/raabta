The author does an amazing job of breaking down complex techniques into easy-to-follow steps, and I've already successfully made several dishes that have seriously impressed my family and friends. From the beautiful photography to the thoughtful ingredient substitution suggestions, this cookbook has quickly become my go-to resource in the kitchen, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
