    "review_text": "We had a blast playing this game with our family during game night! The strategic gameplay mechanics are well-balanced, and the artwork on the board and cards is really impressive. While it took us a few rounds to fully understand all the rules, once we got the hang of it, everyone was totally engaged and having fun. My only minor critique is that the game can run a bit long with more than four players, but overall it's a fantastic addition to our board game collection."
