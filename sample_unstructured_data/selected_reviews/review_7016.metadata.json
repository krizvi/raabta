    "review_text": "I'm beyond frustrated with this cookbook - the recipes are an absolute disaster! The instructions are confusing, measurements seem completely random, and when I actually tried making several dishes, they turned out completely inedible. Half the recipes appear to have never been tested in a real kitchen, and the author seems to have zero understanding of basic cooking techniques. Save your money and time, because this is hands-down the worst cookbook I've ever purchased."
