I absolutely love this cookbook - the recipes are incredibly diverse and each one I've tried has been a home run with my family! The instructions are crystal clear, with gorgeous step-by-step photos that make even complicated dishes feel approachable, and I especially appreciate how the author includes helpful tips and ingredient substitution suggestions for each recipe. From weeknight dinner solutions to impressive dishes for entertaining, this cookbook has quickly become my go-to resource in the kitchen, and I've already recommended it to several of my foodie friends.
