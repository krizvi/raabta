    "review_text": "I was really disappointed with this set of mixing bowls - they looked great online but the quality is terrible. The plastic feels cheap and flimsy, and after just two uses, there are already visible scratches on the surface that make them look worn out. While the nesting design is convenient, I'm worried these won't hold up to regular kitchen use, and for the price I paid, I expected much better durability and craftsmanship."
