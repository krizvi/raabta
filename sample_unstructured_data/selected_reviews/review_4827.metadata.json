    "review_text": "I am absolutely disappointed with this shirt - the fabric is incredibly thin and feels cheap, almost like tissue paper, and it started unraveling at the seams after just one wash. The color faded dramatically and looked completely washed out after wearing it only twice, and the sizing was way off, making it look baggy and unflattering in all the wrong places. Save your money and avoid this terrible piece of clothing."
