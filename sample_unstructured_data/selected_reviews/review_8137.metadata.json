    "review_text": "I am absolutely furious with this terrible mixing bowl set! The cheap plastic warped the first time I tried to use it with hot ingredients, and now it's completely misshapen and unusable. The handles are flimsy, the material feels like it would crack if you looked at it wrong, and for the price I paid, I expected something that would actually last more than one use in my kitchen. Save your money and avoid this garbage kitchenware - I've had better luck with dollar store products."
