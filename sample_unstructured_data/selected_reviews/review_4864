I picked up this cookbook hoping for some fresh recipe ideas, and while there were a few interesting dishes, the overall collection felt a bit uneven. The instructions were clear enough, but some recipes seemed overly complicated for home cooking, and not all of them turned out as well as I expected when I tried them in my kitchen. I appreciated the nice color photographs and the section on basic cooking techniques, but I'm not sure I'll be reaching for this book as often as some of my other cookbooks.
