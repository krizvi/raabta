I'm absolutely furious with this terrible mixing bowl set - the quality is so cheap that after just two uses, the plastic started warping and cracking when I was trying to mix some cake batter. The handles are flimsy and feel like they'll snap off at any moment, and the uneven surface makes it nearly impossible to get a smooth mixing motion without batter splattering everywhere. Save your money and avoid this garbage kitchenware - I've never been so disappointed in a kitchen product in my life.
