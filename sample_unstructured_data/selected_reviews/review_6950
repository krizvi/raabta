I'm absolutely furious with this cheap, poorly constructed mixing bowl set. The handles broke off after just two uses, and when I tried to mix cake batter, the entire bowl started to warp and flex, making a complete mess of my kitchen counter. Save your money and avoid this garbage - I've never been so disappointed in a kitchen product in my life, and I'll definitely be returning these and warning all my friends to stay away.
