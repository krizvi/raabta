I bought this speaker hoping for something that would fill my living room with sound, and it's just okay. The audio quality is decent for casual listening, but it lacks the depth and richness I was expecting - bass is a bit weak and the higher frequencies can sound slightly tinny. Pairing was easy and the battery life is pretty good, lasting around 6-7 hours on a single charge, which is fine for my needs. Overall, it's a middle-of-the-road speaker that does the job but won't blow you away.
