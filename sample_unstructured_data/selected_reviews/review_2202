I picked up this cookbook hoping for some fresh recipe ideas, but it was only somewhat helpful. While the photography is beautiful and a few recipes were genuinely delicious - like the roasted vegetable quinoa salad - many of the instructions felt overly complicated and some ingredient lists were unrealistic for home cooking. The global cuisine section was interesting, but I found myself wishing for more practical weeknight meal suggestions that didn't require hard-to-find specialty ingredients. Overall, it's an okay cookbook that might appeal to more adventurous home cooks, but it won't be my go-to kitchen resource.
