I wasted my hard-earned money on this so-called "life-changing" self-help guide, and it's nothing more than recycled clichés and empty promises. The author's advice is so generic and superficial that it feels like it was written by an AI with no real understanding of human struggles, and the exercises are completely impractical for anyone dealing with actual personal challenges. Save yourself the frustration and money - this book belongs in the trash, not on your shelf of personal development resources.
