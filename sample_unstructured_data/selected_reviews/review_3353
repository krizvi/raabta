I'm absolutely disappointed with this shirt - the fabric feels cheap and thin, and after just one wash, it started unraveling at the seams and losing its shape completely. The color faded dramatically, nothing like what was shown in the online product image, and the sizing was way off, making it look baggy and unflattering. Save your money and avoid this terrible piece of clothing.
