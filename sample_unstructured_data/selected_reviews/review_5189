I picked up this board game hoping for a fun family game night, and it's just okay. The gameplay mechanics are interesting, but the rules are a bit complicated and took us about 30 minutes to fully understand, which slowed down our initial excitement. The components are decent quality, and the artwork is pretty engaging, but the game itself feels a bit unbalanced - some players seemed to have more strategic options than others. While it wasn't a total disappointment, I'm not sure we'll be rushing to play it again anytime soon.
