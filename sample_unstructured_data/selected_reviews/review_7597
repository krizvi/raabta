My 7-year-old daughter absolutely loves this science exploration kit! The materials are high-quality and the guided experiments are perfectly designed to be both educational and fun - she's been learning about basic chemistry and physics concepts without even realizing it. The instructions are clear enough that she can mostly work independently, which boosts her confidence, and I appreciate how the kit encourages hands-on learning and critical thinking. While it's a bit pricey, the engaging content and durable components make it worth the investment for parents looking to spark their child's curiosity about science.
