    "review_text": "I was really disappointed with this speaker after hearing great things about it online. The sound quality is mediocre at best - bass is weak and the high notes sound tinny, which makes listening to music feel flat and unimpressive. While the Bluetooth connection was easy to set up, the battery life is much shorter than advertised, lasting only about 4 hours instead of the promised 8 hours, which is frustrating when I want to use it for a full day. Save your money and look for a different speaker that offers better sound and battery performance."
