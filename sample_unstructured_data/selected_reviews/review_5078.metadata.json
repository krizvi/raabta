    "review_text": "I was really disappointed with this shirt after receiving it. The fabric feels cheap and thin, and after just one wash, the color started to fade noticeably and the stitching near the collar began to unravel. While the design looked nice in the online picture, the actual fit was awkward and boxy, making it look unflattering and uncomfortable to wear. I wouldn't recommend this shirt to anyone looking for a quality piece of clothing."
