Settlers of Catan has quickly become our family's go-to game for game nights! The strategy elements are engaging without being too complex, and the resource trading mechanic keeps everyone involved and interactive throughout the gameplay. While the initial setup can take a bit of time and the rules have a slight learning curve, once you get going, it's incredibly fun and each game feels unique with the randomized board layout. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys strategic board games that aren't too heavy or complicated.
