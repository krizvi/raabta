    "review_text": "I was really disappointed with this learning toy for my 6-year-old. The educational activities seemed promising, but the quality was poor - the pieces felt cheap and flimsy, and they started falling apart after just a few uses. While the concept seemed good, the actual execution was frustrating, and my child lost interest quickly because the interactive elements didn't work as smoothly as I had hoped."
