My 7-year-old daughter absolutely loves this science exploration kit! The materials are high-quality and the instructions are clear enough for her to follow mostly independently, which has been great for building her confidence. While the experiments are engaging and educational, I wish there were a few more activity options included - that's the only reason I'm not giving it a perfect score. Overall, it's been an excellent way to spark her curiosity about basic chemistry and scientific principles.
