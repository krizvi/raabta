    "review_text": "I'm absolutely furious with this shirt - it's the worst clothing purchase I've ever made. The fabric feels incredibly cheap and thin, like it would fall apart after just one wash, and the color faded dramatically even before I wore it a second time. The sizing is completely off too - what was supposed to be a medium looks more like it was meant for a child, and the stitching around the collar is so uneven that it looks like it was sewn by someone who had never seen a shirt before. Save your money and avoid this terrible piece of clothing at all costs."
