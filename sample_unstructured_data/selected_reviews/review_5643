I bought this mixing bowl set hoping it would be a game-changer in my kitchen, but it's just okay. The stainless steel looks nice and they nest well for storage, but the smallest bowl feels a bit flimsy and the grip on the bottom isn't as non-slip as I expected. They get the job done for basic mixing tasks, but I'm not completely impressed - I might look for a more robust set next time.
