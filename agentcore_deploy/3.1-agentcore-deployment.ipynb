    "\n",
    "- **Internet Accessibility**: Make your agent available as a service that can be invoked from anywhere\n",
    "- **Automatic Scaling**: Handle varying loads without manual infrastructure management\n",
    "- **Enterprise Observability**: Built-in CloudWatch monitoring, traces, and metrics\n",
    "- **Memory Capabilities**: Maintain conversation context and learn user preferences over time\n",
    "- **Serverless Infrastructure**: No servers to manage, pay only for what you use\n",
