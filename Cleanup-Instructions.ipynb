    "# 🧹 Workshop Cleanup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides comprehensive cleanup instructions for all resources created during the Unstructured & Structured RAG Agent Workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Note**: If you are at an AWS event using vended accounts, you do NOT need to run these steps.  The workshop environment will delete these resources for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Important**: Running these cleanup steps will permanently delete all workshop resources and cannot be undone. Make sure you have completed all labs and no longer need the resources before proceeding.\n",

    "## 📋 Resources to Clean Up\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop creates the following AWS resources that incur costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab 1 - Unstructured Knowledge Base\n",
    "- Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base (Unstructured)\n",
    "- Amazon S3 bucket with sample data\n",
    "- IAM roles and policies\n",
    "- Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab 2 - Structured Knowledge Base  \n",
    "- Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base (Structured)\n",
    "- Amazon Redshift Serverless namespace and workgroup\n",
    "- Amazon S3 bucket for data staging\n",
    "- IAM roles and policies for Redshift access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab 3 - AgentCore Deployment\n",
    "- Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime endpoints\n",
    "- AgentCore Memory instances\n",
    "- IAM execution roles\n",
    "- CloudWatch logs and metrics\n",
